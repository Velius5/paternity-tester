# Paternity Tester
Did you ever think about DNA test checking your paternity? You know that it is impossible to do a test like this in many places in the world? But there is a free alternative which can help many people - Paternity Test app.
This app was refused by Google Play moderators because it does not comply with google play terms and conditions. That is why I decided to make it open-source.
It can be a perfect example app if you wanna learn ionic framework.

I received many questions from users how it is possible that this app is working. I will try to explain that.

Inheritance is a very complicated process, but there are many "standard things" that are working always in the same way. For example base on parents blood type we can say that it is possible or not that they children will have specify blood type. If both parent have RH- blood type then it is impossible that kid will have RH+ group. The real father needs to have RH+ if mother has RH-.
(more info here: https://canadiancrc.com/paternity_determination_blood_type.aspx)

Using this app you can not really check who is the father. You can only check who is not. That is a difference between DNA tests and my app.

I prepared many tests. Some of them can give you a 100% percent of confidence that you are not a father and some of them can give you only a probability number. If we combine results from many tests then the summary result will be closer to the reality. That is the idea of this app.

You know that almost 30% of fathers are taking care of not their children? Even if this app will not help you because you cannot do some kind of tests when kid is to young - it can help your friends, your family members.

For example dimples test can be done if the child is more than 2 years old. That is because when we are very young then we can have bigger fat level which can couse dimples in childrenhood.

Also freckles are visible only after 4 years of life, so this test cannot be done if our kid is younger.

Thank you for checking and testing this application! I will really apreaciate every fork and comment!
